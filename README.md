===================

Basic project template to kickoff a new Java EE web application. Primarily designed for WildFly (10). Live demo is available at [javaeekickoff.omnifaces.org](http://javaeekickoff.omnifaces.org/).

Following Java EE web applications are built using this template:

- [zeef.com](https://zeef.com)
- [linkpizza.com](https://linkpizza.com)
- [third is currently in progress]

Note: For usage on JBoss EAP 7 alpha/beta or WildFly 10rc4 and below, JASPIC needs to be activated before the application can be deployed. See also http://arjan-tijms.omnifaces.org/2015/08/activating-jaspic-in-jboss-wildfly.html
